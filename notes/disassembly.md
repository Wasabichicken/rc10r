# Disassembly

The outer casing consists of two parts, one black bottom "foot" case, and one red upper "top" case.
The foot case is fastened with 5 larger screws and 1 smaller: two large screws at the back, two
underneath, and one (plus the 1 small) on the side. Once removed, the black foot case can be
removed, revealing the interior. Note that at this point, the interior SoC is still attached to the
upper top case.

In addition, three larger screws reachable from the outside still remains. Two attaches the topmost
"I/O board" to the upper top case, and one attaches to the main board.

TODO: Now what? The main board probably has to come off, requiring removal of the five nuts + discs
fastening the 1/4" instrument jacks. The main board can't be pulled back though, a PCB labelled
"RC-10R PANEL SHEET ASSY 5100065874" is in the way, and nearby there's a parallel flat cable that
connects the main board with the I/O board. Best bet might be a rather large screw that looks like
it fastens the main board to the I/O board, and possibly also the red casing...

## Main board

A CPU in the middle, two DRAM chips. Something that might be some on-board flash memory. A SD card
slot, glued shut.

## I/O board

TODO: Hard to make out without further disassembly. This upper board looks attached to every upper
peripheral, like knobs, buttons, LCDs, etc minus the two foot switches. Connects to main board
through some parallel flat cable.

## Panel sheet

Looks like super simple circuitry for the two footswitches. A set of three cables (1 red, 2 white)
connects the panel sheet with the upper I/O board.
